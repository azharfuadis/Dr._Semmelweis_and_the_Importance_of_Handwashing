# Dr._Semmelweis_and_the_Importance_of_Handwashing

**Project Description**

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthrough discovery: he discovered handwashing and enforced it at his hospital to save hundreds of lives. Perform data analysis to explore the data behind one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine.

To do:
1. How much did handwashing reduce monthly death rates on average?
2. What year had the highest yearly proportion of deaths at each clinic? Visualize the data and store the answer as an integer variable highest_year.
3. Handwashing was introduced on June 1st, 1847. What are the mean proportions of deaths before and after handwashing from the monthly data? Store the result as a 2x2 DataFrame named monthly_summary with the first column, handwashing_started, being a boolean flag and the second column having the mean proportion of deaths.


NB:
Analyze the difference in the mean monthly proportion of deaths before and after the introduction of handwashing using all of the data and calculate a 95% confidence interval. Store your answer as a pandas series confidence_interval.
